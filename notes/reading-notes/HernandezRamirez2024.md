## Summary
- **What is the author saying?**  
  The authors examine how generative AI and managerialism are reshaping design work. They argue that while AI is capable of mimicking creative processes, managerialism reduces design to quantifiable outputs, devaluing the intrinsic nature of design. They emphasise that design cannot be fully proceduralised or automated, and that craft and the unique epistemic/ontological qualities of design remain essential.

## Relevance
- **How is it relevant to your research?**  
  Directly connects to debates on AI’s impact on creative industries, particularly in maintaining human agency and the non-replicable aspects of design thinking. Useful for framing arguments around AI ethics, sustainability, and the preservation of design’s non-quantifiable value.

## Critical appraisal
- **Strengths**  
  - Strong historical context linking to Keynes and technological unemployment.
  - Clear articulation of the dangers of managerialism in creative fields.
  - Good balance between theory and practical implications.
- **Weaknesses / Gaps**  
  - Limited empirical evidence beyond anecdotal cases.
  - Environmental cost arguments could be backed with more data.
  - Focused mainly on design; less transferable to other creative disciplines.

## Key quotes
- "Design work cannot be turned into a procedure or automated using artificial intelligence."
- "Managerialism seeks to instrumentalize and automate design… to generate quantifiable creative outputs."
